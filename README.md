# JavaScript Problem-Solving Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various JavaScript problems. Each function is designed to solve a specific problem using different programming concepts and techniques. The solutions cover a range of topics, including string manipulation, array operations, and more.

## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to a variety of JavaScript problems. These problems range from basic to advanced levels.

## Problem-Solving Approach

In this repository, I employ the following approach to solve JavaScript problems:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Carefully reading and understanding the problem statement.
2. **Planning the Solution**: Breaking down the problem into smaller parts and planning the solution step-by-step.
3. **Writing the Code**: Implementing the solution in JavaScript.
4. **Testing the Solution**: Testing the code with different test cases to ensure its correctness.
5. **Optimization**: Optimizing the solution for better performance and readability.
